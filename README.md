Kobe Bean Bryant was one of the legends that taught me how being a hardworker athlete I should be not just as a athlete but to be a better person on and off the court. His workethic showed me that being a player is not easy, I have to do things double than the expected practice, I believe in "Practice before Practice, Practice during Practice, Practice after Practice" everything is not easy, you have to work hard for it in order to get the best results off and on the court.
